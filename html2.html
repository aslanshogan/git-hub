      Israel (/ˈɪzri.əl, -reɪ-/; Hebrew: יִשְׂרָאֵל, Yīsrāʾēl; Arabic:
      إِسْرَائِيل, ʾIsrāʾīl), officially the State of Israel (מְדִינַת
      יִשְׂרָאֵל, Medīnat Yīsrāʾēl; دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل, Dawlat ʾIsrāʾīl), is a
      country in Western Asia. It is situated on the southeastern shore of the
      Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea, and shares
      borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the
      east, and Egypt to the southwest; it is also bordered by the Palestinian
      territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the east and west,
      respectively. Tel Aviv is the economic and technological center of the
      country, while its seat of government is in its proclaimed capital of
      Jerusalem, although Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is
      unrecognized internationally.[19][fn 5] The land held by present-day
      Israel witnessed some of the earliest human occupations outside Africa and
      was among the earliest known sites of agriculture.[20] It was inhabited by
      the Canaanites during the Bronze Age.[21][20] During the Iron Age, the
      kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged,[22][23] and later fell,
      respectively, to the Neo-Assyrian Empire (c. 720 BCE) and Neo-Babylonian
      Empire (586 BCE).[24][25] During that period, much of the Hebrew Bible was
      written. The region was then ruled by the Achaemenid, Macedonian,
      Ptolemaic, and Seleucid empires. A successful Maccabean revolt led to the
      rise of an independent Hasmonean kingdom, but it was gradually
      incorporated into the Roman Republic.[26][27] A series of large-scale
      Jewish revolts against Roman rule were unsuccessful, and led to wide-scale
      destruction, a high toll of life, and mass displacement. In the Middle
      Ages, the region was part of the Byzantine Empire, Rashidun Caliphate,
      Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, and Fatimid Caliphate. With the
      First Crusade, Crusader states were established. The Ayyubids pushed back
      the crusaders before Muslim rule was fully restored by the Mamluk
      Sultanate, which ceded the territory to the Ottoman Empire at the outset
      of the early modern period. During the 19th century, the Zionist movement
      began promoting the creation of a Jewish homeland in Ottoman Syria.
      Following World War I, Britain was granted control of the region by the
      League of Nations mandate, in what became known as Mandatory Palestine.
      After World War II, the newly formed United Nations adopted the Partition
      Plan for Palestine in 1947, recommending the creation of independent Arab
      and Jewish states, and an internationalized Jerusalem.[28] Partition was
      accepted by the Jewish leadership, but rejected by Palestinian Arab
      leaders and the Arab states.[29] Following a civil war within Mandatory
      Palestine between Yishuv and Palestinian Arab forces, Israel declared
      independence at the termination of the British Mandate. A day later,
      several surrounding Arab countries intervened, leading to the 1948
      Arab–Israeli War, which concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements that
      saw Israel in control of most of the former mandate territory, while the
      West Bank and Gaza were held by Jordan and Egypt respectively. Over
      700,000 Palestinian Arabs, about half of the pre-war Arab population, were
      expelled from or fled the territory Israel would come to control. During
      and immediately after the war, around 260,000 Jews emigrated or fled from
      the Arab world to Israel.[30][fn 6] Israel has since fought wars with
      several Arab countries,[31] and since the 1967 Six-Day War has occupied
      the Golan Heights and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank,
      including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, though whether Gaza remains
      occupied following the Israeli disengagement is disputed. Israel has
      effectively annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, though these
      actions have been rejected as illegal by the international community, and
      established settlements within the occupied territories, which are also
      considered illegal under international law. While Israel has signed peace
      treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and has normalized relations with a number
      of other Arab countries, it remains formally at war with Syria and
      Lebanon, and efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have thus
      far stalled. In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and
      democratic state, and as the nation-state of the Jewish people.[32] The
      country has a parliamentary system, proportional representation, and
      universal suffrage. The prime minister serves as head of government, while
      the Knesset is the unicameral legislature.[33] Israel is a developed
      country and an OECD member,[34] with a population of over nine million
      people as of 2021.[35] It has the world's 29th-largest economy by nominal
      GDP,[16] and ranks nineteenth in the Human Development Index.[18]

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Under the British Mandate (1920–1948), the whole region was known as
      'Palestine' (Hebrew: פלשתינה [א״י], lit. 'Palestine [Eretz Israel]').[36]
      Upon independence in 1948, the country formally adopted the name 'State of
      Israel' (Hebrew: מְדִינַת יִשְׂרָאֵל, Medīnat Yisrā'el [mediˈnat
      jisʁaˈʔel]; Arabic: دَوْلَة إِسْرَائِيل, Dawlat Isrāʼīl, [dawlat
      ʔisraːˈʔiːl]) after other proposed historical and religious names
      including 'Land of Israel' (Eretz Israel), Ever (from ancestor Eber),
      Zion, and Judea, were considered but rejected,[37] while the name 'Israel'
      was suggested by Ben-Gurion and passed by a vote of 6–3.[38] In the early
      weeks of independence, the government chose the term "Israeli" to denote a
      citizen of Israel, with the formal announcement made by Minister of
      Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett.[39] The names Land of Israel and Children
      of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of
      Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively.[40] The name 'Israel'
      (Hebrew: Yisraʾel, Isrāʾīl; Septuagint Greek: Ἰσραήλ, Israēl, 'El (God)
      persists/rules', though after Hosea 12:4 often interpreted as 'struggle
      with God')[41][42][43][44] in these phrases refers to the patriarch Jacob
      who, according to the Hebrew Bible, was given the name after he
      successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord.[45] Jacob's twelve sons
      became the ancestors of the Israelites, also known as the Twelve Tribes of
      Israel or Children of Israel. Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but
      were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations, lasting 430
      years,[46] until Moses, a great-great-grandson of Jacob,[47] led the
      Israelites back into Canaan during the "Exodus". The earliest known
      archaeological artefact to mention the word "Israel" as a collective is
      the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt (dated to the late 13th century
      BCE).[48]"

        Further information: Climate change in Israel Köppen climate
        classification map of Israel and the Golan Heights Temperatures in
        Israel vary widely, especially during the winter. Coastal areas, such as
        those of Tel Aviv and Haifa, have a typical Mediterranean climate with
        cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers. The area of Beersheba and the
        Northern Negev have a semi-arid climate with hot summers, cool winters,
        and fewer rainy days than the Mediterranean climate. The Southern Negev
        and the Arava areas have a desert climate with very hot, dry summers,
        and mild winters with few days of rain. The highest temperature in the
        world outside Africa and North America as of 2021, 54 °C (129 °F), was
        recorded in 1942 in the Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan River
        valley.[305][306] At the other extreme, mountainous regions can be windy
        and cold, and areas at elevation of 750 metres (2,460 ft) or more (same
        elevation as Jerusalem) will usually receive at least one snowfall each
        year.[307] From May to September, rain in Israel is rare.[308][309] With
        scarce water resources, Israel has developed various water-saving
        technologies, including drip irrigation.[310] Israelis also take
        advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy,
        making Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per
        capita—practically every house uses solar panels for water heating.[311]
        There are four different phytogeographic regions in Israel, due to the
        country's location between the temperate and tropical zones, bordering
        the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east. For this
        reason, the flora and fauna of Israel are extremely diverse. There are
        2,867 known species of plants found in Israel. Of these, at least 253
        species are introduced and non-native.[312] There are 380 Israeli nature
        reserves.[313] The Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection has
        reported that climate change "will have a decisive impact on all areas
        of life, including: water, public health, agriculture, energy,
        biodiversity, coastal infrastructure, economics, nature, national
        security, and geostrategy", and will have the greatest effect on
        vulnerable populations such as the poor, the elderly, and the
        chronically ill.[314]
