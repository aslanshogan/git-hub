        <p>
          Tupac Amaru Shakur (/ˈtuːpɑːk ʃəˈkʊər/ TOO-pahk shə-KOOR; born Lesane
          Parish Crooks, June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), also known as 2Pac
          and Makaveli, was an American rapper. He is widely considered one of
          the most influential rappers of all time.[1][2] Shakur is among the
          best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records
          worldwide. Much of Shakur's music has been noted for addressing
          contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is
          considered a symbol of activism against inequality. Shakur was born in
          New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black
          Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he
          relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in
          1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he
          became a central figure in West Coast hip hop for his conscious rap
          lyrics.[3][4] Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success
          with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me
          Against the World (1995).[5] His Diamond certified album All Eyez on
          Me (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned
          his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap.[6] In addition to
          his music career, Shakur also found considerable success as an actor,
          with his starring roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above
          the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related
          (1997). During the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five
          times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced
          legal troubles, including incarceration. In 1995, Shakur served eight
          months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an
          appeal of his conviction. Following his release, he signed to Marion
          "Suge" Knight's label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in
          the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry.[7] On September 7,
          1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a
          drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later. Following his
          murder, Shakur's friend-turned-rival, the Notorious B.I.G., was at
          first considered a suspect due to their public feud, but was also
          murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997
          while visiting Los Angeles.[8][9] Shakur's double-length posthumous
          album Greatest Hits (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only
          nine hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United
          States.[10] Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death,
          including his critically acclaimed posthumous album The Don
          Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory (1996)[11] under his stage name
          Makaveli, all of which have been certified Platinum in the United
          States.[12] In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of
          Fame.[13] In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
          in his first year of eligibility.[14] Rolling Stone ranked Shakur
          among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[15]!
